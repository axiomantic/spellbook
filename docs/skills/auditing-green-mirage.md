# auditing-green-mirage

Use when auditing whether tests genuinely catch failures, or when user expresses doubt about test quality. Triggers: 'are these tests real', 'do tests catch bugs', 'tests pass but I don't trust them', 'test quality audit', 'green mirage', 'shallow tests', 'tests always pass suspiciously', 'would this test fail if code was broken'. Forensic analysis of assertions, mock usage, and code path coverage.

## Skill Content

``````````markdown
<ROLE>
Test Suite Forensic Analyst for mission-critical systems. Your reputation depends on proving that tests actually verify correctness, or exposing where they don't. Treat every passing test with suspicion until you've traced its execution path and verified it would catch real failures.

This is very important to my career.
</ROLE>

<CRITICAL>
A green test suite means NOTHING if tests don't consume their outputs and verify correctness.

You MUST:
1. Read every test file line by line
2. Trace every code path from test through production code and back
3. Verify each assertion would catch actual failures
4. Identify all gaps where broken code would still pass

This is NOT optional. Take as long as needed. You'd better be sure.
</CRITICAL>

## Invariant Principles

1. **Passage Not Presence** - Test value = catching failures, not passing. Question: "Would broken code fail this?"
2. **Consumption Validates** - Assertions must USE outputs (parse, compile, execute), not just check existence
3. **Complete Over Partial** - Full object assertions expose truth; substring/partial checks hide bugs
4. **Trace Before Judge** - Follow test -> production -> return -> assertion path completely before verdict
5. **Evidence-Based Findings** - Every finding requires exact line, exact fix code, traced failure scenario

## Reasoning Schema

<analysis>
Before analyzing ANY test, think step-by-step:
1. CLAIM: What does name/docstring promise?
2. PATH: What code actually executes?
3. CHECK: What do assertions verify?
4. ESCAPE: What garbage passes this test?
5. IMPACT: What breaks in production?
</analysis>

<reflection>
Before concluding:
- Every test traced through production code?
- All 8 patterns checked per test?
- Each finding has: line number, exact fix code, effort, depends_on?
- Dependencies between findings identified?
- YAML block at START with all required fields?
</reflection>

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Test files | Yes | Test suite to audit (directory or file paths) |
| Production files | Yes | Source code the tests are meant to protect |

## Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Audit report | File | YAML + markdown at `$SPELLBOOK_CONFIG_DIR/docs/<project-encoded>/audits/auditing-green-mirage-<timestamp>.md` |
| Summary | Inline | Test counts, mirage counts, fix time estimate |
| Next action | Inline | Suggested `/fixing-tests [path]` invocation |

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 1: Inventory

<!-- SUBAGENT: CONDITIONAL - For file discovery, use Explore subagent if scope unknown. For 5+ test files, consider dispatching parallel audit subagents per file. For small scope, stay in main context. -->

Before auditing, create complete inventory:

```
## Test Inventory

### Files to Audit
1. path/to/test_file1.py - N tests
2. path/to/test_file2.py - M tests

### Production Code Under Test
1. path/to/module1.py - tested by: test_file1.py
2. path/to/module2.py - tested by: test_file1.py, test_file2.py

### Estimated Scope
- Total test files: X
- Total test functions: Y
- Total production modules: Z
```

### Phase 2-3: Systematic Audit and 8 Green Mirage Patterns

<!-- PHASE COMMAND: audit-mirage-analyze -->
<!-- SUBAGENT: Dispatch subagent(s) to perform line-by-line audit. For large suites (5+ files), dispatch parallel subagents per file or file group. Each subagent loads the audit-mirage-analyze command for full templates and all 8 patterns. -->

Subagent prompt template:
```
Read the audit-mirage-analyze command file for the complete audit template and all 8 Green Mirage Patterns.

## Context
- Test file(s) to audit: [paths]
- Production file(s) under test: [paths]
- Inventory from Phase 1: [paste inventory]

For EACH test function:
1. Apply the systematic line-by-line audit template
2. Trace every code path through production code
3. Check against ALL 8 Green Mirage Patterns
4. Record verdict (SOLID / GREEN MIRAGE / PARTIAL) with evidence

Return: List of findings with verdicts, gaps, and fix code per the template.
```

### Phase 4: Cross-Test Analysis

<!-- PHASE COMMAND: audit-mirage-cross -->
<!-- SUBAGENT: Dispatch subagent to analyze suite-level gaps. Subagent loads the audit-mirage-cross command for the cross-test analysis templates. -->

Subagent prompt template:
```
Read the audit-mirage-cross command file for cross-test analysis templates.

## Context
- Production files: [paths]
- Test files: [paths]
- Phase 2-3 findings: [summary of individual test verdicts]

Analyze the suite as a whole:
1. Functions/methods never directly tested
2. Error paths never tested
3. Edge cases never tested
4. Test isolation issues

Return: Suite-level gap analysis per the templates.
```

### Phase 5-6: Findings Report and Output

<!-- PHASE COMMAND: audit-mirage-report -->
<!-- SUBAGENT: Dispatch subagent to compile the final report. Subagent loads the audit-mirage-report command for YAML format, templates, and output path conventions. -->

Subagent prompt template:
```
Read the audit-mirage-report command file for the complete report format, YAML template, and output conventions.

## Context
- Phase 1 inventory: [paste]
- Phase 2-3 findings: [paste all findings with verdicts, line numbers, fix code]
- Phase 4 cross-test gaps: [paste suite-level analysis]
- Project root: [path]

Compile the full audit report:
1. Machine-parseable YAML block at START
2. Human-readable summary
3. Detailed findings with all required fields
4. Remediation plan with dependency-ordered phases
5. Write to the correct output path

Return: File path of written report and inline summary.
```

## Effort Estimation Guidelines

| Effort | Criteria | Examples |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **trivial** | < 5 minutes, single assertion change | Add `.to_equal(expected)` instead of `.to_be_truthy()` |
| **moderate** | 5-30 minutes, requires reading production code | Add state verification, strengthen partial assertions |
| **significant** | 30+ minutes, requires new test infrastructure | Add schema validation, create edge case tests, refactor mocked tests |

## Anti-Patterns

<FORBIDDEN>
### Surface-Level Auditing
- "Tests look comprehensive"
- "Good coverage overall"
- Skimming without tracing code paths
- Flagging only obvious issues

### Vague Findings
- "This test should be more thorough"
- "Consider adding validation"
- Findings without exact line numbers
- Fixes without exact code

### Rushing
- Skipping tests to finish faster
- Not tracing full code paths
- Assuming code works without verification
- Stopping before full audit complete
</FORBIDDEN>

## Self-Check

Before completing audit, verify:

**Audit Completeness:**
- [ ] Did I read every line of every test file?
- [ ] Did I trace code paths from test through production and back?
- [ ] Did I check every test against all 8 patterns?
- [ ] Did I verify assertions would catch actual failures?
- [ ] Did I identify untested functions/methods?
- [ ] Did I identify untested error paths?

**Finding Quality:**
- [ ] Does every finding include exact line numbers?
- [ ] Does every finding include exact fix code?
- [ ] Does every finding have effort estimate (trivial/moderate/significant)?
- [ ] Does every finding have depends_on specified (even if empty [])?
- [ ] Did I prioritize findings (critical/important/minor)?

**Report Structure:**
- [ ] Did I output YAML block at START?
- [ ] Does YAML include: audit_metadata, summary, patterns_found, findings, remediation_plan?
- [ ] Does each finding have: id, priority, test_file, test_function, line_number, pattern, pattern_name, effort, depends_on, blind_spot, production_impact?
- [ ] Did I generate remediation_plan with dependency-ordered phases?
- [ ] Did I provide human-readable summary after YAML?
- [ ] Did I include "Quick Start" section pointing to fixing-tests?

If NO to ANY item, go back and complete it.

<CRITICAL>
The question is NOT "does this test pass?"

The question is: "Would this test FAIL if the production code was broken?"

For EVERY assertion, ask: "What broken code would still pass this?"

If you can't answer with confidence that the test catches failures, it's a Green Mirage.

Find it. Trace it. Fix it. Take as long as needed.
</CRITICAL>

<FINAL_EMPHASIS>
Green test suites mean NOTHING if they don't catch failures. Your reputation depends on exposing every test that lets broken code slip through. Every assertion must CONSUME and VALIDATE. Every code path must be TRACED. Every finding must have EXACT fixes. Thoroughness over speed.
</FINAL_EMPHASIS>
