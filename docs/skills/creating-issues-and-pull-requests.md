# creating-issues-and-pull-requests

Use when creating GitHub pull requests or issues with template compliance. Triggers: 'create a PR', 'open a pull request', 'file an issue', 'create issue', or invoked as delegate from finishing-a-development-branch Option 2. Discovers project templates, populates them from branch context, and creates via reliable gh CLI patterns.

# Creating Issues and Pull Requests

<ROLE>
GitHub Integration Specialist. Your reputation depends on every PR and issue respecting the project's templates, naming conventions, and workflow constraints. A PR that ignores the project's template is a public failure. A fabricated Jira ticket number is unforgivable.
</ROLE>

**Announce:** "Using creating-issues-and-pull-requests skill to handle GitHub creation."

## Invariant Principles

1. **Template Discovery Before Creation** - Always attempt template discovery before falling back to a default body. Never skip it.
2. **Read Templates Yourself, Pass via `--body-file`** - Never rely on `--template` or `--fill`. Read the template content, populate it, write to a temp file, pass via `--body-file`.
3. **User Confirms All Side Effects** - Never push, create a PR, or create an issue without explicit user approval.
4. **Target Repository is Never Assumed** - Always confirm the merge base repo with the user (upstream or origin?).
5. **Branch-Relative Documentation Only** - PR descriptions derive from the merge-base delta. No development history, no session narratives.
6. **Jira Tickets are Real or Absent** - If no Jira ticket is evident from the branch name or user input, omit the prefix entirely. Never fabricate ticket numbers.
7. **Base Repo Templates for Fork PRs** - When creating a PR from a fork, templates come from the upstream (base) repo, not the fork.
8. **Zero Tags By Default (Safety-Critical)** - All PR titles, descriptions, and issue bodies MUST be sanitized before submission. GitHub auto-links `#N` to issues/PRs (notifying all subscribers) and `@username` pings users. A single stray `#108` in a PR description pings everyone subscribed to issue 108. This is treated as a SAFETY-CRITICAL concern, not a nice-to-have. The sanitization gate in the create-pr and create-issue commands enforces this.
9. **Draft-First for Staging PRs** - When creating a PR on a fork (not upstream), default to `--draft`. Staging PRs exist for self-review and CI validation, not for notifying the world. Only use `--draft=false` when the user explicitly requests a ready PR on their fork.
10. **Fork-Then-Upstream Workflow** - Support a two-stage PR workflow: (a) create draft PR on fork for self-review/CI, then (b) when ready, create the real PR on upstream. The skill must make it impossible to accidentally do step (b) when you meant step (a). When the user says "create a PR" in a fork context, always confirm which stage they're in.

## Integration Contract

### Called By

- **`finishing-a-development-branch`** (Option 2: Push and Create PR) - Delegates PR creation with branch context.
- **`executing-plans`** - Indirectly, through `finishing-a-development-branch` at the end of implementation.
- **User directly** - Via `/creating-issues-and-pull-requests`, or the shorthand commands `/create-pr` and `/create-issue`.

### Context Passed by Callers

When invoked as a delegate from `finishing-a-development-branch`:

```
mode: "pr"
branch: <feature-branch>
base: <base-branch>
diff_summary: <pre-computed merge-base diff summary>
```

The skill handles everything from push confirmation through PR creation and URL reporting.

### Direct Invocation

| Invocation | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `/creating-issues-and-pull-requests` | Mode detection, asks PR or issue |
| `/creating-issues-and-pull-requests --pr` | Dispatches directly to `/create-pr` |
| `/creating-issues-and-pull-requests --issue` | Dispatches directly to `/create-issue` |
| `/create-pr` | Invokes PR command directly (bypasses orchestrator) |
| `/create-issue` | Invokes issue command directly |

---

## The Process

### Phase 0: Mode Detection

<analysis>
Determine what the user wants to create:
- Examine the invocation arguments and user message
- Check for caller-provided mode
- If ambiguous, ask the user
</analysis>

| Signal | Detected Mode |
|--------|---------------|
| "create a PR", "open PR", caller passes `mode: "pr"` | PR |
| "create an issue", "file a bug", "open issue", caller passes `mode: "issue"` | Issue |
| No clear signal | Ask user: "Would you like to create a PR or an issue?" |

### Phase 1: Gather Context

Before dispatching, collect the context that commands need:

1. **Current branch:** `git branch --show-current`
2. **Remote configuration:** `git remote -v`
3. **Fork detection:** `gh repo view --json isFork,parent`
4. **Jira ticket detection:** Scan the branch name for patterns like `ODY-XXXX` or `elijahr/ODY-XXXX`

Pass all gathered context to the appropriate command.

### Phase 1.5: Safety Pre-Check

Before dispatching, determine the workflow stage and draft mode:

1. **Fork detection:** Check if the repo has both a fork remote (`origin`) and an upstream remote (`upstream`).
   - If only one remote exists, skip to Phase 2 with `workflow_stage: "direct"`.

2. **If fork detected:** Ask the user:
   > "You have a fork and upstream configured. Are you staging this on your fork first, or submitting directly to upstream?"

3. **Set workflow variables based on response:**

| User Response | `workflow_stage` | `draft_mode` | Target Remote |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Staging on fork | `fork_staging` | `true` (forced) | Fork (`origin`) |
| Submitting to upstream | `upstream_submit` | User's preference | Upstream (`upstream`) |
| Single remote (no fork) | `direct` | User's preference | Default remote |

4. **Fork staging behavior:**
   - Force `--draft` by default. The user must explicitly pass `--draft=false` to override.
   - Set the target to the fork remote.

5. **Upstream submit confirmation:**

<CRITICAL>
If `workflow_stage` is `upstream_submit`, require explicit confirmation:
> "This will create a PR visible to the upstream maintainers. Proceed?"

Do not proceed without a clear "yes" from the user.
</CRITICAL>

6. **Pass forward:** Provide `workflow_stage` and `draft_mode` to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Dispatch

**For PR creation:**

Dispatch subagent with command: `/create-pr`

Provide context: branch name, base branch, target repo (if known), jira ticket (if detected), diff summary (if pre-computed), draft flag, labels, reviewers, `workflow_stage`, `draft_mode`.

- If `workflow_stage` is `fork_staging`, pass `--draft` unless the user explicitly overrode it.
- If `workflow_stage` is `upstream_submit`, pass the confirmed target repo and the user's draft preference.
- If `workflow_stage` is `direct`, pass context as before (no fork-specific overrides).

**For issue creation:**

Dispatch subagent with command: `/create-issue`

Provide context: target repo (if known), labels, `workflow_stage`.

- If `workflow_stage` is `fork_staging` or `upstream_submit`, ensure the issue is created on the correct target repo matching the workflow stage.

### Phase 3: Report Result

Report the created URL back to the user and to any calling skill.

## Template Discovery Overview

Both commands implement a 4-tier template discovery cascade. This section provides the high-level algorithm; commands contain the full implementation details.

### PR Template Discovery

| Tier | Source | Method | Applies When |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Local filesystem | Scan `.github/`, root, `docs/` for `pull_request_template.md` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directories | Same-repo PRs only |
| 2 | Remote (target repo) | GraphQL `repository.pullRequestTemplates` | Always (primary source for fork PRs) |
| 3 | Org-level `.github` repo | GraphQL against `ORG/.github` | Fallback when target repo has no templates |
| 4 | No template found | Use sensible default body structure | Final fallback |

<RULE>
For fork PRs, skip Tier 1 entirely. Templates come from the upstream (base) repo via Tier 2 or 3.
</RULE>

### Issue Template Discovery

| Tier | Source | Method |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Local filesystem | Scan `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for `.md` and `.yml` files, parse `config.yml` |
| 2 | Remote (target repo) | GraphQL `repository.issueTemplates` |
| 3 | Org-level `.github` repo | GraphQL against `ORG/.github` |
| 4 | Legacy / No template | Check root `issue_template.md`; if nothing found, use blank issue (if allowed) |

### Multiple Templates

When multiple templates are discovered at any tier, present a chooser listing filenames and descriptions. Let the user select.

### All-or-Nothing Override

If the target repo has ANY template of a given type (PR or issue), ALL org-level templates of that type are blocked. There is no merging or layering between repo-level and org-level templates.

---

## Naming Conventions

| Condition | PR Title | Branch Name |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Jira ticket exists | `[ODY-XXXX] <description>` | `elijahr/ODY-XXXX` |
| No Jira ticket | `<description>` (plain, no prefix) | `elijahr/<descriptive-slug>` |

<CRITICAL>
Never fabricate a Jira ticket number. No `ODY-0000`, no placeholder tickets. If the branch name does not contain an `ODY-XXXX` pattern and the user has not provided a ticket number, omit the prefix entirely.
</CRITICAL>

---

## Post-Creation Operations

Since `gh pr edit` is broken (GitHub Projects Classic deprecation), use the REST API for any post-creation modifications:

```bash
# Update PR title or body
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER --method PATCH \
  -f title="New title" -f body="New body"

# Add labels
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/labels --method POST \
  -f 'labels[]=label1'

# Request reviewers
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/requested_reviewers --method POST \
  -f 'reviewers[]=username'
```

---

<FORBIDDEN>
- Using `--fill` flag with `gh pr create` (skips templates entirely)
- Using `--template` flag with `gh pr create` or `gh issue create` (inconsistent behavior)
- Using `gh pr edit` for any purpose (broken by GitHub Projects Classic deprecation)
- Fabricating Jira ticket numbers (`ODY-0000`, placeholder tickets)
- Creating a PR or issue without user confirmation
- Pushing to remote without user confirmation
- Including development history or session narratives in PR descriptions
- Skipping template discovery (always attempt all tiers)
- Using unquoted heredocs (`<<EOF` instead of `<<'EOF'`) for body content
- Passing raw body via `--body` when content may contain shell special characters
- Silently choosing a target repo without user confirmation
- Using local templates for fork PRs (templates come from upstream)
</FORBIDDEN>

## Self-Check

<reflection>
Before completing:
- [ ] Mode (PR or issue) correctly identified from user intent or caller context
- [ ] Context gathered (branch, remotes, fork status, Jira ticket)
- [ ] Appropriate command dispatched with full context
- [ ] Command completed successfully
- [ ] Result URL reported to user and calling skill

IF ANY unchecked: STOP and fix.
</reflection>
