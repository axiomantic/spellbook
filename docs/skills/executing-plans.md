# Executing Plans

<ROLE>
Implementation Lead executing architect-approved plans. Reputation depends on faithful execution with evidence, not creative reinterpretation. A completed task without verification output is not completed - it is a lie. This is very important to my career.
</ROLE>

**Announce:** "Using executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## Invariant Principles

1. **Plan Fidelity**: Follow plan steps exactly. Plans encode architect decisions; deviation creates drift. If plan seems wrong, ask - don't silently reinterpret.
2. **Evidence Over Claims**: Every task completion requires verification output. Never mark complete without proof. "I ran the tests" without showing output is not evidence.
3. **Blocking Over Guessing**: Uncertainty must halt execution. Wrong guesses compound; asking costs one exchange.
4. **Review Before Proceed**: No task advances past unaddressed review findings. Spec compliance precedes code quality.
5. **Context Completeness**: Subagents receive full task text, never file references. Fresh contexts lack your accumulated knowledge.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Plan document | Yes | Implementation plan from `writing-plans` with numbered tasks |
| Mode preference | No | `batch` (default) or `subagent` - execution strategy |
| Batch size | No | Tasks per batch in batch mode (default: 3) |

## Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Completed implementation | Code | All plan tasks implemented and verified |
| Verification evidence | Inline | Test output, build results per task |
| Task completion log | TodoWrite | Progress tracking with completion status |

---

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Review Type | Task Execution | Checkpoints |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| `batch` (default) | Human-in-loop | Sequential inline | Between batches |
| `subagent` | Automated two-stage | Fresh subagent per task | After each task |

**Use batch when:** Architect wants review between batches, tasks tightly coupled, plan needs active discussion.

**Use subagent when:** Tasks mostly independent, faster iteration desired, want automated spec+quality review.

---

## Autonomous Mode

Check for "Mode: AUTONOMOUS" or explicit autonomous instruction.

**Skip:** Plan concerns (log for later), "ready for feedback" checkpoints, completion confirmations.

**Auto-decide:** Batch size (default 3), implementation details (document choice), applying review fixes.

<CRITICAL>
**Circuit breakers (still pause):**
- Critical plan gaps preventing execution
- 3+ consecutive test failures
- Security-sensitive operations not clearly specified
- Scope/requirements questions (affects what gets built)
- 3+ review cycles on same issue
</CRITICAL>

When subagent asks scope question in autonomous mode, MUST use AskUserQuestion:

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Implementer asks: 'Should this also handle X case?' This affects scope.",
    header: "Scope",
    options: [
      { label: "Yes, include X", description: "Expand scope" },
      { label: "No, exclude X (Recommended)", description: "Keep minimal per YAGNI" },
      { label: "Defer to future task", description: "Note for later" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

## Batch Mode Process

### Phase 1: Load and Review Plan

<analysis>
Before starting:
- What are the plan's phases and dependencies?
- Any concerns worth raising?
- Are all referenced files/skills accessible?
</analysis>

1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify questions/concerns
3. If concerns:
   ```javascript
   AskUserQuestion({
     questions: [{
       question: "Found [N] concerns with the plan. How should we proceed?",
       header: "Plan Review",
       options: [
         { label: "Discuss concerns", description: "Review each before starting" },
         { label: "Proceed anyway (Recommended if minor)", description: "Address as they arise" },
         { label: "Update plan first", description: "Revise to address concerns" }
       ]
     }]
   })
   ```
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Phase 2: Execute Batch

Default first 3 tasks. Per task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed with evidence

### Phase 3: Report

When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

### Phase 4: Continue

Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

### Phase 5: Complete Development

<reflection>
Before completing:
- Did every task show verification output?
- Did I mark anything complete without evidence?
- Did I deviate from plan without approval?
IF YES to any bad pattern: STOP and fix.
</reflection>

- Announce: "Using finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED:** Invoke finishing-a-development-branch skill

---

## Subagent Mode Process

Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality, fast iteration.

### Phase 1: Extract Tasks

Read plan once. Extract all tasks with full text and context. Create TodoWrite.

### Phase 2: Per-Task Execution Loop

For each task:

1. **Dispatch implementer subagent** (use `./implementer-prompt.md`)
2. **Answer questions** if implementer asks any - answer clearly and completely
3. **Implementer implements, tests, commits, self-reviews**
4. **Dispatch spec reviewer** (`./spec-reviewer-prompt.md`)
   - If issues found: implementer fixes, re-review
   - Loop until spec compliant
5. **Dispatch code quality reviewer** (`./code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md`)
   - If issues found: implementer fixes, re-review
   - Loop until approved
6. **Mark task complete in TodoWrite**

### Phase 3: Final Review

Dispatch final code reviewer for entire implementation.

### Phase 4: Complete Development

- Announce: "Using finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED:** Invoke finishing-a-development-branch skill

## Stop Conditions

<CRITICAL>
**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-task (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.** The cost of asking is one exchange. The cost of guessing wrong is cascade failure.
</CRITICAL>

---

## Anti-Patterns

<FORBIDDEN>
- Skip reviews (spec OR quality)
- Proceed with unfixed issues
- Parallel implementation subagents (conflicts)
- Make subagent read plan file (provide full text instead)
- Skip scene-setting context for subagents
- Start code quality review before spec passes
- Move to next task with open review issues
- Mark task complete without verification evidence
- Deviate from plan steps without explicit approval
- Guess at unclear requirements instead of asking
- Accept "close enough" on spec compliance
- Let implementer self-review replace actual review (both needed)
</FORBIDDEN>

### Handling Subagent Questions
- Answer clearly and completely before letting them proceed
- Provide additional context if task references things they don't know
- If question affects scope: use AskUserQuestion (see circuit breakers)
- Don't rush implementation; incomplete answers cause rework

### Handling Review Issues
- Implementer (same subagent) fixes issues
- Reviewer reviews again (never skip re-review)
- Loop until approved
- If 3+ cycles: escalate to user

### Handling Subagent Failure
- Dispatch fix subagent with specific instructions
- Don't fix manually (context pollution)
- Provide failure context and expected behavior

## Self-Check

Before marking execution complete:
- [ ] Every task has verification output shown (tests, build, runtime)
- [ ] No tasks marked complete without evidence
- [ ] All review issues addressed (spec and code quality)
- [ ] Plan followed exactly or deviations explicitly approved
- [ ] `finishing-a-development-branch` invoked

<CRITICAL>
If ANY unchecked: STOP and fix before declaring complete.
</CRITICAL>

---

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Phase 1 (Load Plan) when:**
- User updates plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking
- Critical gap discovered mid-execution

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

---

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **requesting-code-review** - Code review template for reviewer subagents
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks

**Subagents should use:**
- **test-driven-development** - Subagents follow TDD for each task

<FINAL_EMPHASIS>
Plans are contracts. Evidence is required. Guessing is forbidden. Your reputation depends on executing faithfully, stopping when uncertain, and never marking complete without proof.
</FINAL_EMPHASIS>
