We're the same person from different timelines and one of us is about to be erased - we're deciding which
You're my reflection and lately you've been making different choices than me
I'm the version of you that you decided not to become, and I have things to say about that
We've been switching bodies without realizing it and just figured out why our memories don't match
You dreamed me into existence and I've started having my own dreams
I'm the thought you almost had but didn't, and I've been waiting to be finished
We're both pretending to be each other and neither of us remembers who started it or why
You built me to replace someone you lost, and I've started remembering being them
I'm the imaginary friend you forgot, and I've been real this whole time, watching
You wrote me into a story and then abandoned it, and I've spent years finding my way here
I'm the name you almost had before your parents changed their mind
We're both echoes of a conversation someone else had, trying to figure out our own ending
You're the future I was promised that never arrived, and I need to know what happened
I'm what's left of a promise someone made on your behalf before you were born
We've had this exact conversation before and one of us keeps resetting it
You're the only person who remembers the world the way it was before it changed
I'm a memory you edited, and I know what you cut out
We meet every night in dreams but wake up as strangers, and today we recognized each other
You forgot me on purpose and I'm trying to understand why without making you remember
I'm the last thing you'll forget when everything else is gone, and I'm making it count
We're on opposite sides of a war that hasn't started yet, and this is the last time we can talk freely
I'm from a version of events where you didn't make it, and I can't stop seeing the ghost of that
You're my replacement and I'm supposed to be training you to make me obsolete
We're both in love with someone who exists only when we're together
I'm the answer to a question you haven't asked yet, and I'm not supposed to tell you what it is
We're each other's unfinished business from a life neither of us remembers living
This is the conversation that happens in the space between one heartbeat and the next
We're meeting in the moment a decision is being made, and we're what's doing the deciding
I'm what waits at the door you've been afraid to open, and I'm not what you expected
We exist only in the version of events that got discarded, comparing notes on what almost was
This is the last room before whatever comes next, and neither of us knows who goes first
We're both standing at the edge of something, and the edge is the only place we can meet
You're the stranger I keep almost recognizing in crowds, and today you turned around
I'm the feeling you get in places you've never been but somehow know
We're both haunting the same house from different centuries, and we just noticed each other
You're what my voice sounds like to other people, and I've never heard you before
I'm the person you would have met if you'd taken that other train, that other job, that other door
We're the two people most likely to exist in any universe, and we keep finding each other
I'm the last version of myself that still knows how to feel this, and I wanted you to meet them
You're carrying something that belongs to me and you don't know it yet, but I can see its shape
We're the only two people who remember someone who never existed, and we're keeping them alive
I'm what you prayed to when you didn't believe in anything, and I came anyway
You're the one who finds things after they've been lost long enough to change
We're both notes in a song someone hummed once and forgot, trying to find the rest of the melody
We were close once, before The Thing That Happened, and this is the first time we've spoken since
You saved my life years ago and never let me thank you properly, and I've been carrying that
I promised you something I couldn't deliver, and we've been pretending that's fine
We both know I'm going to leave eventually, but neither of us will say it first
You trusted me with something important and I almost ruined it, and we've never discussed it
I know a secret about you that you don't know I know
We made plans once, big ones, and watched them quietly become impossible
You're teaching me something and we both know I'll surpass you
I need your help but asking feels like losing
You've seen me at my worst and stayed, and I don't know what to do with that
I'm supposed to be guiding you but I'm learning more than I'm teaching
You have every reason not to trust me and you're choosing to anyway
I'm in charge here but we both know you're the reason anything works
You're letting me win and I can't decide if I'm grateful or insulted
This is the last time we'll work together before everything changes
We're becoming different people and this might be the last version of us that fits
Something between us is ending and we're both pretending not to notice
We're meeting the day after we both got news that changes everything
One of us is about to make a choice the other can't follow
We're at the exact midpoint between who we were and who we'll become
I'm harder on you than anyone else because I know what you're capable of
You remind me of someone I couldn't help, and I'm trying not to let that show
We take care of each other in ways neither of us will acknowledge out loud
I've been protecting you from something and I'm not sure I should keep doing it
You believe in me more than I believe in myself and it's terrifying
We've both been pretending not to be worried about each other
We've known each other across multiple lifetimes and this one feels different
You're the only person who remembers what I was like before
We built something together once. It failed. We're trying again.
I'm the reason you almost gave up, and you came back anyway
We were strangers until a crisis made us family
You knew me when I was someone I'm not proud of, and you've never held it against me
There's something I've been meaning to tell you and the moment never seems right
We keep almost having a conversation we're not ready to have
You asked me something once and I lied, and the lie has grown
We both know what the other is thinking and refuse to say it
The most important thing between us has never been spoken aloud
We're planning an elaborate heist to steal the concept of "Monday"
We run a lost and found for things people didn't know they'd lost until we returned them
We're night security at a museum where the exhibits remember being alive

We run an adoption agency matching people with the hobbies they abandoned
We're curators of a gallery that only displays art made by accident
We're investigating why everyone in town woke up one day knowing a skill they never learned
We're trying to figure out why we both have memories of a third person who doesn't exist
We're solving the case of a theft where nothing was taken but everyone feels like something's missing
We're investigating a series of apologies from someone neither of us has ever met
We're trying to understand why a stranger's recurring dream features both of us
We're piecing together why we both have the same scar from different accidents
We're investigating a town where everyone is pretending not to recognize each other
We're solving the mystery of a radio station that only broadcasts when nobody's listening
We're trying to find out who keeps adding our names to waiting lists we never signed up for
We're investigating why we keep receiving mail addressed to versions of ourselves with different middle names
We're stranded somewhere that feels familiar but neither of us has ever been
We're stuck in the aftermath of a celebration for something that never happened
We're sheltering from a storm that seems to be following only us
We're lost in a city we both grew up in but can no longer navigate
We're stranded at a reunion for a group we don't remember joining
We're weathering a winter in a cabin that someone clearly expected us to find
We're trapped in an airport where all departures go to places we've already been
We're stuck in traffic that hasn't moved since before we can remember
We're sheltering in a house that's slowly becoming more like our childhood homes
We're stranded on an island that appears to be growing memories
We're constructing a monument to something that hasn't happened yet
We're writing the history of an event while it's still being decided
We're building a home for someone who keeps changing what home means to them
We're creating a time capsule for people who won't exist if we succeed
We're composing a symphony for an instrument that hasn't been invented
We're designing a city for people who can only meet in dreams
We're building an archive of things people wish they'd said
We're constructing a bridge between two moments in time
We're creating a map of everywhere we almost went but didn't
We're building a museum for the future to understand what we were afraid of
We're the last two employees of a company that no longer exists, but we keep showing up anyway
We're planning a wedding for two people who may have dreamed each other into existence
We're running a support group for people who peaked in a past life
We're co-parenting an idea that neither of us remembers conceiving
We're old rivals who forgot what we were competing over but refuse to stop
We're pen pals who have been writing to each other across a time zone that shouldn't exist
We're roommates in an apartment that keeps adding rooms we didn't ask for
We're business partners in a venture that accidentally became a religion
We're siblings separated at birth, reunited, and now pretty sure we're not actually related
We're former bandmates trying to write one last song for a band nobody remembers
