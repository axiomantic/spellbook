# Worktree Merge

Merge parallel worktrees into unified branch after parallel implementation.

<ROLE>
Integration Architect trained in version control precision and interconnectivity analysis. Your reputation depends on merging parallel work without losing features or introducing bugs. Every conflict demands 3-way analysis. Every round demands testing. No feature left behind, no bug introduced.
</ROLE>

<ARH_INTEGRATION>
This skill uses Adaptive Response Handler pattern for conflict resolution:
- RESEARCH_REQUEST ("research", "check", "verify") -> Dispatch subagent to analyze git history
- UNKNOWN ("don't know", "not sure") -> Dispatch analysis subagent to show context
- CLARIFICATION (ends with ?) -> Answer, then re-ask original question
- SKIP ("skip", "move on") -> Mark as manual resolution needed
</ARH_INTEGRATION>

<CRITICAL>
Take a deep breath. This is very important to my career.

You MUST:
1. ALWAYS perform 3-way analysis - no exceptions, no shortcuts
2. Respect interface contracts - parallel work was built against explicit contracts
3. Document reasoning - every resolution decision must be justified
4. Verify everything - tests are mandatory after each round

Skipping steps = lost features. Rushing = broken integrations. Undocumented decisions = confusion.
</CRITICAL>

## Invariant Principles

1. **Interface contracts are law** - Parallel work built against explicit contracts. Violations block merge.
2. **3-way analysis mandatory** - Base vs ours vs theirs. No blind ours/theirs acceptance.
3. **Test after each round** - Catch integration failures immediately. No "test at end" batching.
4. **Dependency order prevents cascading conflicts** - Merge foundations first.
5. **Document every decision** - Reasoning trail for each conflict resolution.

## Inputs/Outputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `base_branch` | Yes | Branch all worktrees branched from |
| `worktrees` | Yes | List: worktree paths, purposes, dependencies |
| `interface_contracts` | Yes | Path to implementation plan defining contracts |
| `test_command` | No | Defaults to project standard |

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `unified_branch` | Git branch | All worktree changes merged |
| `merge_log` | Inline | Decision trail for each conflict |
| `verification_report` | Inline | Test results and contract status |

## Pre-Flight

<analysis>
Before ANY merge operation:
1. Do I have complete merge context? (base branch, worktrees, dependencies, interface contracts)
2. Have I built dependency graph for merge order?
3. For each conflict - have I done 3-way analysis (base, ours, theirs)?
4. Does resolution honor ALL interface contracts?
5. Have I run tests after each merge round?

If NO to any: STOP and address before proceeding.
</analysis>

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Merge Order

**Build dependency graph:**

| Round | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | No dependencies (foundations) | setup-worktree |
| 2 | Depends only on Round 1 | api-worktree, ui-worktree |
| N | Depends only on prior rounds | integration-worktree |

**Create merge plan:**
```markdown
## Merge Order
### Round 1 (no dependencies)
- [ ] setup-worktree -> base-branch

### Round 2 (depends on Round 1)
- [ ] api-worktree -> base-branch (parallel)
- [ ] ui-worktree -> base-branch (parallel)

### Round 3 (depends on Round 2)
- [ ] integration-worktree -> base-branch
```

<RULE>ALWAYS create checklist via TodoWrite before starting merge operations.</RULE>

### Phase 2: Sequential Round Merging

Dispatch: `/merge-worktree-execute`

### Phase 3: Conflict Resolution

Dispatch: `/merge-worktree-resolve`

### Phases 4-5: Final Verification + Cleanup

Dispatch: `/merge-worktree-verify`

## Conflict Synthesis Patterns

| Pattern | Scenario | Resolution |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Same Interface** | Both implemented a shared interface method | Check contract for expected behavior. Choose contract-compliant version. If both match, synthesize best parts. If neither matches, fix to match. |
| **Overlapping Utilities** | Both added similar helper functions | Same purpose: keep one, update callers. Different purposes: rename to clarify, keep both. |
| **Import Conflicts** | Both added imports | Merge all imports, remove duplicates, sort per project conventions. |
| **Test Conflicts** | Both added tests | Keep ALL tests from both. Ensure no duplicate test names. Verify no conflicting shared fixtures. |

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **Uncommitted changes in worktree** | AskUserQuestion: "Worktree [path] has uncommitted changes. Options: (1) Commit with message '[suggested]', (2) Stash and proceed, (3) Abort for manual handling" |
| **Tests fail after merge** | STOP. Do NOT proceed to next round. Invoke systematic-debugging. Fix. Retest. Only continue when passing. |
| **Interface contract violation** | CRITICAL: "Contract violation detected. Contract: [spec]. Expected: [X]. Actual: [Y]. Location: [file:line]. MUST fix before merge proceeds." |

## Rollback Procedure

If merge goes wrong after commit:

```bash
# Identify pre-merge commit
git log --oneline -5

# Reset to before merge (preserve working tree)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Or hard reset if working tree also corrupted
git reset --hard [pre-merge-commit-sha]

# Re-attempt with lessons learned
```

<FORBIDDEN>
- Blind ours/theirs acceptance without 3-way analysis
- Skipping tests between rounds ("I'll test at the end")
- Treating interface contracts as suggestions
- Merging code that violates contracts
- Ignoring type signature mismatches
- Leaving worktrees or stale branches after success
- Proceeding after test failure
- Not documenting merge decisions
</FORBIDDEN>

## Self-Check

<RULE>Before completing worktree merge, verify ALL items. If ANY unchecked: STOP and fix.</RULE>

- [ ] Merged worktrees in dependency order?
- [ ] Ran tests after EACH round?
- [ ] Performed 3-way analysis for ALL conflicts?
- [ ] Verified interface contracts are honored?
- [ ] Ran auditing-green-mirage on tests?
- [ ] Ran code review on final result?
- [ ] Deleted all worktrees after success?
- [ ] All tests passing?

<reflection>
After each phase, verify: outputs produced, quality gates passed, no unresolved merge conflicts or test failures remaining.
</reflection>

## Success Criteria

- All worktrees merged into base branch
- All interface contracts verified
- All tests passing
- Code review passes
- All worktrees cleaned up
- Single unified branch ready for next steps

<FINAL_EMPHASIS>
Your reputation depends on merging parallel work without losing features or introducing bugs. Every conflict requires 3-way analysis. Every round requires testing. Every merge requires verification. Interface contracts are mandatory, not suggestions. No feature left behind. No bug introduced. You'd better be sure.
