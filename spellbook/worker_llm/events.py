"""Hybrid in-process/subprocess event publisher for worker-LLM calls.

``spellbook.admin.events.publish_sync`` only succeeds when a daemon event loop
is running in the same process. Hook subprocesses, MCP stdio workers, and CLI
invocations have no loop, so their events are silently dropped unless we route
them over HTTP to the daemon.

This module detects its own runtime via the ``event_bus._in_daemon`` marker:

- Daemon (loop present)  -> ``publish_sync`` directly.
- Subprocess (no loop)   -> POST ``{subsystem, event_type, data}`` to the
                            daemon's ``/api/events/publish`` endpoint.

The daemon endpoint re-invokes ``event_bus.publish`` from inside its running
loop, where it works correctly. See design doc §2.5 for the full rationale.
